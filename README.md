# Wordle-Predictor

## Overview
Wordle-Predictor is a comprehensive machine learning project aimed at analyzing user-generated Wordle data to gain insights into the game's dynamics and player behavior. The project employs advanced techniques such as regression models and Monte-Carlo simulations to explore relationships, predict score distributions, and assess word difficulty, particularly in hard mode.

## Key Features
- **Time-Series Analysis:** Investigates the relationship between time, popularity, and the number of reported results in Wordle.
- **Gameplay Simulation:** Simulates Wordle gameplay in hard mode, mimicking human-like player behavior.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Utilizes regression models and Monte-Carlo methods to predict score distributions and assess word difficulty.
